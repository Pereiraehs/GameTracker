# GameTracker
My personal GameTracker built with Neo4j. This repository currently includes the database setup and initial data model for tracking games by status (Finished, Abandoned, Want to Play, etc.), platform, and genre. Future enhancements may include data import scripts and more complex querying capabilities.
